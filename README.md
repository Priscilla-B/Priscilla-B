### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Priscilla. I have experience in data analysis, machine learning, no-code development, technical training, and some front-end web development. 


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on interactive data analysis web apps with python, html and css that consolidates data from multiple sources such as excel sheets, sql, etc.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build stand alone interactive data analysis/machine learning web apps that accept user inputs and communicates useful information to such users
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data analysis projects (with python, sql, power bi, etc.), machine learning projects, and even web development projects that include some data analysis or machine learning functionalities!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about getting into data science from non-technical background, how to leverage your non-technical experience in a technical role, creating interactive data analysis dashboards online, anything!
